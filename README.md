###Our robot, driven by Daivik, performed consistently well during matches at the FGC UAE National Championships, achieving 1st Place, winning the Grand Final Challenge Award and the Winning Alliance Award and we had alot of fun developing and testing it accorss the course of the entire season. 

###The design of our robot heavily inspired the design of the final Team UAE Robot that acompanied the team to Panama City where Team UAE won its first ever gold medal at the First Global Challenge by winning 1st PLace in the Innovator Award for our New Technology Experience Project, STASH.
